            <p>I've been working on Java (and Javascript) from my very first gig. Starting with 1.6 and growing until
                Java 8.<br>
                Eight years later ('bout time) I decided to change gears and started using Kotlin. I felt it like
                breeze of fresh air.<br>
                Then, I felt more comfortable learning new languages and decided to become a language agnostic
                programmer. That's why I started with Golang. Big fan of the gopher lang.<br>
                While on the pandemic, I made a masters course on Machine Learning and there I started to use
                Python. Still not using it for the big environments (API creation and stuff) but to do some scripting
                and jupyter notebooks I felt it a must.<br>
                I also feel familiar with shell languages like Bash or Powershell, despite I'm not an expert... yet...
